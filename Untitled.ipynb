    "Why it’s written this way:\n",
    "SageMaker requires data to be serialized (converted into a specific format) before sending it to the model for inference.\n",

    "\n",
    "Drops the columns y_no and y_yes from the test_data DataFrame.\n",
    "Converts the remaining data into a NumPy array using .values.\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",
    "y_no and y_yes are likely the target variables (labels) that the model is trying to predict. Since we’re preparing the input data for inference, we don’t need these columns.\n",
    ".values converts the DataFrame into a NumPy array, which is the required input format for the CSVSerializer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",
    "SageMaker needs to know the format of the input data being sent to the model. By setting content_type to text/csv, we tell SageMaker that the input data is in CSV format.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",

    "\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "Sends the test_data_array to the deployed SageMaker model for inference.\n",
    "The model returns the predictions as a byte string, which is then decoded into a UTF-8 string using .decode('utf-8').\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",
    "The predict method sends the serialized data to the model and retrieves the predictions.\n",
    "The predictions are returned as a byte string, so we decode it into a regular string for easier processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "Splits the predictions string into lines (since each line represents a prediction).\n",
    "Uses np.loadtxt to parse the lines into a NumPy array, treating commas (',') as delimiters.\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",
    "The predictions are returned as a CSV-formatted string (e.g., \"0.1,0.9\\n0.2,0.8\").\n",
    "splitlines() splits the string into individual lines, and np.loadtxt parses each line into numerical values.\n",
    "This converts the predictions into a NumPy array, which is easier to work with for further analysis or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s written this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the array tells us how many predictions were made and the format of the output (e.g., (n_samples, n_classes) for classification or (n_samples,) for regression).\n",
    "This is useful for verifying that the predictions are in the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of the Workflow\n",
    "Prepare the data: Remove unnecessary columns and convert it into a NumPy array.\n",
    "Set up the predictor: Configure the predictor to accept CSV-formatted input.\n",
    "Serialize the data: Use CSVSerializer to convert the data into CSV format.\n",
    "Make predictions: Send the data to the model and retrieve the predictions.\n",

    "Verify the output: Check the shape of the predictions to ensure they are in the expected format.\n",
